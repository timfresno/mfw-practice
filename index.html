        <h3>I actually took classes at geekwise in 2015 right after I finished high school, but for naive reasons I decided not to pursue that path any further. Now four years later I've pretty much had my fill of doing nothing with my life so I decided to come back and give these classes another try. After completing the intro class for the 2nd time I realized that I was a fool for putting this stuff down, for whatever reason it's alot more fun to me now! Also I want to make a website for my friends' skate crew to sell their merchandise so everything I learn here will also be applied to that website. </h3>
